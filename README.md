Framework for agent based modelling

---

Welcome to *Pinkant*, a dedicated repository for exploring and developing agent-based models (ABM). Our focus is on creating and sharing innovative models that simulate the behavior of agents in various complex systems.

> What is Agent-Based Modeling?
> Agent-based modeling is a computational approach that simulates the interactions of autonomous agents (which can be individuals or collective entities) to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ABM is used in various fields like biology, economics, social science, and network theory, providing insights into complex phenomena that emerge from the individual actions of agents.
